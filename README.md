# fivepd-json
The result of our failed LUA attempt (coming soon for LSPDFR too)

# What is it?
FivePD JSON is a way to make callouts using JSON Files. It's a callout itself but uses your config(s) as instructions

In simple terms you give the callout the instructions and we make it happen. We're the brain.

This can help you create callouts if you are not sure how to code or simply don't want to.

# Collaborating
You may make a pull request and make edits to the code. You may not redistribute the callout.

# What I can/can't do with FivePD JSON?
We want to make sure you can do a whole lot of things with FivePD JSON. If there's something that you want to do that you cannot please let us know so we can work on making it work!

We are also working on FivePD JSON but for plugins. This will also allow you to make even more things!
